}
\arguments{
\item{infile}{the input fasta, vcf or varscan tab file}

\item{virus}{HCMV HSV1 HSV2 VZV HHV6b Adeno}

\item{all_mutations}{when FALSE only recognised resistant variants present are returned.}
}
\value{

}
\description{
Command line version of the website application
Takes as input a VCF, varscan tab or fasta file.
The program assumes variant files are generated relative to Merlin strain.
Fasta files if not Whole Genome, or not aligned / assembled relative to Merlin 
are Processed using MAFFT & snp-sites.
In this case the output files are returned to your working directory.
